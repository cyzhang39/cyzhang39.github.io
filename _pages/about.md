# Hey — I’m Tim 👋

I build and study AI systems at the intersection of **computer vision**, **multimodal learning**, and **efficient models**.  
This site is a lightweight hub for my work, ideas, and occasional notes.


## What I’m into right now

- 👁️ **Vision–language** under tight compute (quantization, retrieval, reranking)  
- 🛠️ **Practical ML**: from data & evaluation to deployment to real world usage
- 🤖 **AI agents** that can reason, plan, and act across tasks  

## News / Now

- **Now** — MSCS application + Interview Prep
- **Summer 2025** — Finished my undergraduate double major CS + Math from the University of Maryland College Park
- **Spring 2025** — Experiments on ultra-low-bit VLM quantization; writing up results  
- **2024** — Object detection baselines + custom DETR variant for the DAVE dataset

*(I keep this list short; older notes move to posts when relevant.)*


## Highlights (quick glance)

- ⚙️ Efficient models: ultra-low-bit **quantization** for VLMs  
- 🔎 Retrieval that helps downstream tasks (RAG)  
- 🧩 CV foundations: detection and video datasets  



## About this site

You’ll find short updates and pointers to my work.
